package gdt.dmp.highmaps.client.plotOptions;

/**
 * Represents the general plot options available for all OHLC type series, which can be set either generically
 * on the chart via the {@link gdt.dmp.highmaps.client.StockChart#setOHLCPlotOptions(gdt.dmp.highmaps.client.plotOptions.OHLCPlotOptions)} )} method or directly on a
 * series via the {@link gdt.dmp.highmaps.client.Series#setPlotOptions(gdt.dmp.highmaps.client.plotOptions.PlotOptions)} method.
 * <p/>
 * Note that OHLC series types are only available when using the {@link gdt.dmp.highmaps.client.StockChart} widget.
 * <p/>
 * Note that these options are only needed if you want to specifically control the general options
 * for all OHLC type series in the entire chart.  If you instead want to control the options for all
 * series in the chart (not just those of an OHLC type), then you can use the {@link gdt.dmp.highmaps.client.plotOptions.SeriesPlotOptions}
 * class instead.  Or, if you want to control the plot options for just one series (and not all OHLC type
 * series in the chart), use the {@link gdt.dmp.highmaps.client.Series#setPlotOptions(gdt.dmp.highmaps.client.plotOptions.PlotOptions)} method.
